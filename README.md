The tasks/todos are going to be objects that are dynamically created with a class or factory

At minimum they should have title, description, dueDate, priority, properties
should add notes and checkilst properties

Should have projects that act as parents to the tasks/todos

When a User first opens the app there should be a 'default' project displayed

Users should be able to create new projects and choose whisch project their tasks/todos go into

Seperate the application logic into modules 

DOM manipulation should be in modules only
    modules:
        creating new tasks/projects
        setting tasks to complete
        changing task priority

date-fns gives a bunch of handy funtions for formatting and manipulating dates and times and should be included

UI should be anle to:
    - view all projects 
    - view all tasks/todos in each project (mainly title and due date)
    - expand a single todo/task to xee/edit its details 
    - delete tasks/todos and projects
